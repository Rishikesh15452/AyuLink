Ayulink OCR Service Instructions
===============================

1. Starting the OCR Service:
   - Open a terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to the project directory: cd c:\Hackex_Files\Ayulink\src\components
   - Run the command: py simple_ocr_server.py
   - The service will start on http://localhost:8000

2. Using the OCR Service:
   - Once the service is running, open your Ayulink dashboard in a web browser
   - Log in to the dashboard
   - Navigate to the file upload section at the bottom of the dashboard
   - Upload any file (PDF, JPEG, JPG)
   - The system will automatically process the file with OCR
   - Results will be displayed in the "OCR Results" section

3. Service Endpoints:
   - GET http://localhost:8000/ - Status page
   - GET http://localhost:8000/results - Mock OCR results
   - POST http://localhost:8000/upload - File upload endpoint (not fully implemented in mock version)

4. Troubleshooting:
   - If you see "Failed to connect to OCR service" message, make sure the Python service is running
   - Check that no firewall is blocking the connection
   - Ensure you're using the correct port (8000 by default)

5. For Production Use:
   - Install the full dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Install Tesseract OCR on your system
   - Use the full ocr_backend.py service instead of the simple mock server
   - Update the JavaScript to point to the correct backend URL
